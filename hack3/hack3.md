# Task

The theme for Hack 3 is Advent: build something that counts the days until Christmas, and each day something happens (either automatically or manually).  Your solution should include a method to speed up time in order to validate that it works.



# Suggestions

The following are some suggestions to give a feel for the sort of thing you might attempt (remember time is limited and some of these may take considerably more time than you have available):

* A simple console app that displays the time remaining until Christmas, and each day prints a message saying that another day has passed.
* A web site with a traditional advent calendar theme - click on the door to open.
* An arduino that flashes a bulb every day until Christmas.
* A robotic arm that displays fingers representing the days remaining (each day, it puts a finger down).
